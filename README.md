# Filling the gap in distribution ranges and conservation status in _Ctenomys_ (Rodentia, Ctenomyidae).
Caraballo, D. A., López, S. L., Botero-Cañola, S., y Gardner, S. L. Journal of Mammalogy, in press

This paper proposes new conservation status based on rewieved _Ctenomys_ distribution areas while checking for they overlap with protected areas and the conservation status of the species from this genus and includes an interactive map. This is made using Rstudio, tidyverse, sf, and leaflet packages.

-  *data_preparation.R*: manipulates distributions for area calculations and data visualization

-  *figures_1_and_2.R*

-  *figure_3.html*: html sankey code.

Files with _SD_ prefixes generates the Supplementary Data:
-  **Supplementary Data SD1**. Interactive map showing _Ctenomys_ geographic distribution areas (DAs), protected areas (PAs), and their intersection.

-  **Supplementary Data SD4**. List of protected areas (PAs) that overlap _Ctenomys_ geographic distributions.

-  **Supplementary Data SD5**. Interactive table showing distribution areas, conservation status, overlap with protected areas, and habitat transformation in the past 20 years for 68 extant _Ctenomys_ species.
